# Creating Token
This project involves creating a Solidity contract for a basic token system. This contract provides basic functionality for managing a token system, including creating and destroying tokens while maintaining proper balances and safety checks.
## Description
The Solidity contract establishes a basic token system on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes variables to store token details such as name, abbreviation, and total supply, as well as a mapping to track token balances for each address. This contract facilitates token creation through a mint function and token destruction via a burn function. Overall, this contract offers essential functionalities for token management, enabling token creation, destruction, and balance tracking.
## Getting Started
### Executing Program
In order to run this code, you can use remix. To get started go to the remix website.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file.Copy and paste the given code into the file.

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar.Once compiled, the contract can be deployed to the Ethereum blockchain through various means, such as using Remix's deployment feature.
After deployment, the contract's functions (mint and burn) can be interacted with by sending transactions to the contract's address.
